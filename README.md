# 📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis using Python

This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset to extract insights about customer behavior, segmentation, and campaign effectiveness. It uses Python for data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling to help marketers make informed decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Marketing campaigns are crucial for targeting the right audience and maximizing conversion. This project involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer segmentation and profiling
- Predictive modeling (e.g., campaign success prediction)

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
- `sklearn` – Machine learning (classification, clustering)
- `scipy` – Statistical computations

## 🧾 Key Features and Functionality

### ✅ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Converting categorical variables into numerical
- Creating new features (e.g., customer age, income groups)

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Age, income, and spending score distributions
- Campaign response rates by demographic
- Correlation heatmaps and pair plots

### ✅ Segmentation & Modeling
- RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- Clustering (e.g., K-Means) for customer groups
- Logistic Regression or Decision Trees for campaign success prediction

### ✅ Visualizations
- Bar charts, pie charts, histograms
- Cluster plots, heatmaps
- Model performance metrics

## 📊 Sample Outputs

- 🎯 Conversion rate by age or income
- 🧠 Customer clusters based on behavior
- 📈 Campaign effectiveness visualizations
